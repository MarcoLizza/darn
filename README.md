# DARN!

## INTRODUCTION

*Darn!* is my own personal interpretation of the [#1GAM](http://onegameamonth.com) theme, which for June 2016 was set to *COUCH*.

Made during #1GAM June 2016 gamejam.

## GAME STATUS

Prototypal.

## INSTRUCTIONS

## TOOLS

Graphics have been realized with [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net) and [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/it/).
